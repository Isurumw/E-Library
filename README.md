App specification.

* This app is built using [Express Generator Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript) web framework, and is using [Typescript Lang](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for writing the app's logic. 
* It uses Node's [Cluster API](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html), this helps us to take advantage of multi-core systems & to handle the load.
* For Database - Repo contains the use of [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) (ie. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) object modeling for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)).
* For Routing - Repo contains the use of [express-router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) & have distributed Routes into few files, below routes folder.
* For Route Auth Middleware - Web routes are configured with [Express Jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jwt) while the API routes are configured with [JSON Web Token](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt).
* For views - Repo contains the use of [PUG](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) template engine.
